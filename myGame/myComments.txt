The only feature that I have not been able to replicate is the smooth rolling/falling animation of the block that the demo flash game had.
Apart from that shadow effects are also not present as of now.

The game controls are the left/right/up/down keyboard keys, to move the block around and spacebar to restart the level in case the player wins/loses.

Apart from that holding the left mouse button and dragging will let the user rotate the scene thereby viewing the scene in 3d.

"F1" will enable fullscreen mode and "Esc" will quit the game.
